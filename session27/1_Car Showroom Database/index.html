    <!-- Scenario: You have just started working at a car dealership, and your boss wants you to create a simple database for cars. Your task is to create an object representing a car.
✅ Tasks:
Create an object car with properties: brand, model, and year.
Add a method getInfo that returns a string with the car’s details (e.g., "Toyota Corolla, 2022").
Access, modify, and delete a property, then log the object to see the changes. -->


    <script>
        const car = {
            brand: "Toyota",
            model: "Corolla",
            year: 2022,

            func: function dd() {
                return `${this.brand} ${this.model}, ${this.year ? this.year : 'year not exist'}`;
            }
        };

        console.log(car.brand);

        car.model = "Camry";

        delete car.year;

        console.log(car);
        console.log(car.func());
