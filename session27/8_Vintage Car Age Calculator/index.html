    <title>8. Vintage Car Age Calculator</title>
</head>

<body>

    <!-- Scenario: A vintage car enthusiast wants a simple way to check how old their cars are. Your job is to create a system where car age can be calculated dynamically.
✅ Tasks:
Create a constructor function Car with properties brand and year.
Add a method age() using Car.prototype that calculates the car’s age from the current year.
Create instances and test them. -->


    <script>

        function Car(brand, year) {
            this.brand = brand;
            this.year = year;
        }


        Car.prototype.age = function () {
            const currentYear = new Date().getFullYear();
            return currentYear - this.year;
        };


        const car1 = new Car("Toyota", 2005);
        const car2 = new Car("Ford", 2015);


        console.log(`${car1.brand} is ${car1.age()} years old.`);
        console.log(`${car2.brand} is ${car2.age()} years old.`);

    </script>
