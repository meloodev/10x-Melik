    <!-- Scenario: You are developing a virtual pet adoption website where users can adopt different animals. You need to create a class for animals and allow users to see some basic details about their chosen pet.
âœ… Tasks:
Create a class Animal with a constructor that takes name and species (e.g., "Buddy", "Dog").
Add a method makeSound() that logs "Animal sound" by default.
Create an instance of the class and call the method. -->



    <script>
        class Animal {
            constructor(name, species, sound) {
                this.name = name;
                this.species = species;
                this.sound = sound;
            }

             makeSound() {
                console.log(this.sound);
            }
        }

    
        const pet = new Animal("Buddy", "Dog", 'rr');
        const pet1 = new Animal("Buddy", "Dog", 'rr2');

     
        pet.makeSound(); 
        pet1.makeSound(); 
    </script>
