</head>

<body>
    <!-- Scenario: You are developing a backend system for an e-commerce platform. Products should have basic details and additional rules for electronics.
âœ… Tasks:
Create an ECommerceProduct class with properties name, price, and category.
Implement methods for applying a discount and checking stock availability.
Extend it into ElectronicsProduct with a warrantyPeriod property and override a method to apply additional electronics-specific discounts. -->
