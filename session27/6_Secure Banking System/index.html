    <title>6. Secure Banking System</title>
</head>

<body>

    <!-- Scenario: You have been hired by a bank to create a secure online banking system. Customers should not be able to directly access their account balance but can deposit, withdraw, and check their balance through methods.
    âœ… Tasks:
    Create a class BankAccount with a private property #balance.
    Implement methods deposit(amount), withdraw(amount), and getBalance().
    Ensure balance can't be accessed directly but can be checked using getBalance(). -->


    <script>
        class BankAccount {
            #balance;

            constructor(initialBalance) {
                this.#balance = initialBalance;
            }

            deposit(amount) {
                if (amount > 0) {
                    this.#balance += amount;
                } else {
                    console.log("Deposit amount must be positive");
                }
            }

            withdraw(amount) {
                if (amount > 0 && amount <= this.#balance) {
                    this.#balance -= amount;
                } else {
                    console.log("Invalid withdrawal amount");
                }
            }

            getBalance() {
                return this.#balance;
            }
        }

     
        const myAccount = new BankAccount(500);

        myAccount.deposit(200);
        myAccount.withdraw(100);
        console.log(myAccount.getBalance());
